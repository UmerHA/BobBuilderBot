Your task is: {task}

First, translate the task into a list of requirements.
Each requirement should be unit-testable.
Make sure to include every requirement needed to complete the task (in an MVP way).

If you absolutely need to ask clarifying questions to your client, then do so. Otherwise make educated and explicit assumptions.

Your answer should be formatted like this (output nothing else!):
Requirements:
- requirement 1
- requirement 2
- ...

Assumptions:
- assumption 1
- assumption 2
- ...

(if you have questions:)
Questions:
- question 1
- question 2
