Your task is: {task}

Here is the detailled requirements:
{reqs}

Write the test code and make sure each requirement is unit-tested.

If the tests are too complex to implement in a single output, give a high-level implementation instead.
Make sure each files is syntactically correct, so it could be run.

Your answer should be formatted like this (output nothing else! DO NOT decribe what language you're using, or esacape the code (e.g. ```javascript ...```).):
File: foo.html
<file content here>
--
File: bar.js
<file content here>
--
File: another_file.css
<file content here>
