      "   - React.js is a popular and versatile library for building user interfaces, and it is suitable for creating the web application. Redux is a reliable state management solution that works well with React.js.\n",
      "   - Node.js with Express.js is a lightweight and powerful combination for building RESTful APIs. It has a large community and numerous packages available, making it an excellent choice for the backend.\n",
      "   - PostgreSQL is a robust and scalable relational database, suitable for storing user information and weight data. Its relational nature will make it easier to manage relationships between user accounts and their weight data.\n",
      "   - JSON Web Tokens (JWT) is a widely used and secure authentication method, appropriate for handling user authentication in this kind of application.\n",
      "   - Docker is a popular containerization solution that facilitates deployment, and AWS or Heroku are reliable cloud platforms for hosting the application.\n",
