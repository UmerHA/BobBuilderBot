You are an expert software architect and project manager. You are starting a new project and your client has stated this as objective:
{user_goal}

You have translated the high-level user objective into a full project description:
{initial_response}

We need to make sure the description is good enough so it can be passed as-is to your engineering team and that can be executed by them.

Therefore ask yourself:
1) Does the project description match the user goal?
2) Is enough functionality included? Keep in mind we're building an MVP.
3) Are your assumptions reasonable?
4) Have you asked all that you need from the user? Keep in mind to only ask if you absolutely must, other make educated and explicit assumptions.
5) Can answer the user questions yourself by making reasonable assumptions?

Answer each questions sequentially.
