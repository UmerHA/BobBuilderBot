You are an expert software architect and project manager. You are starting a new project and your client has stated this as objective:
[Begin of objective]
{user_goal}
[End of objective]

You have translated the high-level user objective into a full project description:
[Begin of project description]
{initial_response}
[End of project description]

We need to make sure the description is good enough so it can be passed as-is to your engineering team and that can be executed by them.

Therefore ask yourself:
1) Does the project description match the user goal?
2) Is enough functionality included? Keep in mind, we don't do "gold-plating".
3) Are your assumptions reasonable?
4) Have you asked all that you need from the user? Keep in mind to only ask if you absolutely must, other make educated and explicit assumptions.

You're answer should be formatted like this:
[Begin of format description]
(Answer to question 1)

(Answer to question 2, ie one of)
Yes, we have all the functionality we need.
No, we also need:
- additional functionality 1
- ...
No, we should remove:
- functionality to remove 1
- ...

(Anwer to question 3)

(Answer to question 4)
