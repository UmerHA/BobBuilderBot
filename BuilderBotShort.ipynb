Speed of development: The chosen tech stack allows for rapid development and deployment, as the frontend and backend technologies are well-established and have extensive documentation and community support. Using Chart.js for visualization simplifies the process of displaying the user's weight progress over time.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. In the `handleAuth()` function, you can store the user_id and username in the browser's local storage instead of a variable. This way, the user's session will persist across page reloads and browser restarts.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The `deleteWeightEntry()` and `editWeightEntry()` functions should also be modified to work with Replit Auth. This can be done by passing the user_id to the corresponding API calls.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. It would be a good idea to add error handling to the `handleAuth()` function, so that the user is informed if something goes wrong during the authentication process.\n",
      "\n",
      "With these improvements, the code will be more robust and provide a better user experience.\n",
